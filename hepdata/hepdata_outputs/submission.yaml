comment: '  A search for $t$-channel exchange of leptoquarks (LQs) is performed using
  proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the CMS detector
  at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $138\text{ fb}^{-1}$.
  Eight scenarios are considered, in which nonresonant scalar or vector LQs couple
  up or down quarks to electrons or muons, for dilepton invariant masses above $500$
  GeV. LQ masses are probed up to $5$ TeV, heavier than those probed by previous pair-production
  and single-production searches. The differential distributions of dilepton events
  are fit to templates constructed from simulated standard model events that are reweighted
  to the form of the Drell-Yan cross section with LQ exchange. Limits are set on LQ-fermion
  coupling strengths for various LQ masses at $95\%$ confidence level (CL). For scalar
  LQs with masses in the $1-5$ TeV range, coupling values greater than $0.3-1.0$ $(0.4-1.3)$
  are excluded for LQs coupled to an electron/muon and an up (down) quark.  For vector
  LQs, coupling values greater than $0.1-0.5$ $(0.3-1.4)$ are excluded for LQs coupled
  to an electron/muon and an up (down) quark.'
