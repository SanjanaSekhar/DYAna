  A search for $t$-channel exchange of leptoquarks (LQs) is performed using proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of $138\fbinv$. Eight scenarios are considered, in which nonresonant scalar or vector LQs couple up or down quarks to electrons or muons, for dilepton invariant masses above $500$ GeV. LQ masses are probed up to 5 TeV, heavier than those probed by previous pair-production and single-production searches. The differential distributions of dilepton events are fit to templates constructed from simulated standard model events that are reweighted to the form of the Drell--Yan cross section with LQ exchange. Limits are set on LQ-fermion coupling strengths for various LQ masses at $95\%$ confidence level (CL). For scalar LQs with masses in the 1--5 TeV range, coupling values greater than 0.3--1.0 (0.4--1.3) are excluded for LQs coupled to an electron/muon and an up (down) quark.
  For vector LQs, coupling values greater than 0.1--0.5 (0.3--1.4) are excluded for LQs coupled to an electron/muon and an up (down) quark.
